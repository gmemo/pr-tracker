## 🏗️ BUILD & DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### **Building the PWA** (IMPORTANT!)

Always use this command to build for production:
```bash
npm run build:web
```

**What this does:**
1. Runs `npx expo export --platform web` to build the app
2. Copies PWA assets from `public/` to `dist/`:
   - `manifest.json` - PWA configuration
   - `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` - App icons
   - `apple-touch-icon.png` - iOS home screen icon
3. Updates `dist/index.html` with proper manifest and icon links

**DO NOT use** `npx expo export --platform web` directly - it won't include PWA assets!

### **PWA Assets Location**

All PWA assets are in the `public/` folder:
- `public/manifest.json` - PWA config (name, colors, display mode)
- `public/icon-192.png` - 192×192 icon for Android
- `public/icon-512.png` - 512×512 icon for high-res displays
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` - 180×180 icon for iOS
- `public/favicon.png` - Browser tab icon

These are automatically copied to `dist/` during build.

### **Deployment to Vercel**

**Automatic deployment:**
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push

# Vercel automatically detects push and deploys!
# Wait 2-3 minutes, then check your Vercel URL
```

**Manual deployment via CLI:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (first time only)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

**Build settings (already configured in vercel.json):**
- Build Command: `npm run build:web`
- Output Directory: `dist`
- Framework: None (custom)

### **Docker Deployment (Optional)**

Docker container has been **removed to save resources**, but config is preserved in repo.

To run Docker locally again:
```bash
# Build and start
npm run build:web
docker build -t pr-tracker .
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3000

# Stop and clean up when done
docker compose down
docker rmi pr-tracker
```

**When to use Docker:**
- Testing local deployment
- Self-hosting on your own server
- Sharing with users on local network
- Development environments

**Why we removed it:**
- Vercel handles public deployment (better!)
- Saves disk space (~5-10 MB)
- No need to rebuild container for every change
- Can easily rebuild when needed

2. **No real-time sync** - Must manually export/import between devices
3. **No social features** - Privacy-focused, single-user app
4. **Safari theme color** - iOS Safari doesn't respect theme-color changes dynamically

### Technical Debt
- Consider migrating to TanStack Query for data management
- Evaluate Zustand or Jotai instead of Context API (performance)
- Add error boundary components
- Improve TypeScript strict mode compliance

---

## 📊 ANALYTICS & METRICS (Optional Future)

If user base grows, consider privacy-respecting analytics:
- [ ] Plausible Analytics (privacy-focused, GDPR compliant)
- [ ] Anonymous usage statistics (opt-in only)
- [ ] Crash reporting (Sentry or similar)

Important: Maintain privacy-first approach. Always opt-in, never track without consent.

---

## 💰 MONETIZATION OPTIONS (Future Consideration)

Current: 100% free, donation-based

Potential future models (if development continues):
1. **Keep free forever** + donations (current model)
2. **Freemium**: Advanced features require one-time payment ($4.99)
   - Training plans
   - Cloud sync
   - Advanced analytics
3. **Premium version**: Separate "Pro" version on app stores
4. **Coaching features**: Paid add-on for personal trainers

Decision: Wait for user feedback before considering paid features.

---

## 🔄 MIGRATION & UPDATES

### Changing App Name Later
Files to update:
1. `app.json` - "name" and "slug" fields
2. `dist/manifest.json` - "name" and "short_name"
3. `App.tsx` - NavigationContainer documentTitle
4. `package.json` - "name" field
5. `README.md` - All references

Deployment impact:
- Vercel: Project name can be changed in settings
- Domain: Add custom domain anytime (no code changes)
- Git: Rename repo on GitHub, update remote URL

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Buy domain (Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains)
2. Add to Vercel: Settings → Domains → Add
3. Update DNS records (Vercel provides instructions)
4. HTTPS automatic (Vercel handles SSL certificates)

No app code changes needed for custom domain!
