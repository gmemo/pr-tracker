2. **No real-time sync** - Must manually export/import between devices
3. **No social features** - Privacy-focused, single-user app
4. **Safari theme color** - iOS Safari doesn't respect theme-color changes dynamically

### Technical Debt
- Consider migrating to TanStack Query for data management
- Evaluate Zustand or Jotai instead of Context API (performance)
- Add error boundary components
- Improve TypeScript strict mode compliance

---

## üìä ANALYTICS & METRICS (Optional Future)

If user base grows, consider privacy-respecting analytics:
- [ ] Plausible Analytics (privacy-focused, GDPR compliant)
- [ ] Anonymous usage statistics (opt-in only)
- [ ] Crash reporting (Sentry or similar)

Important: Maintain privacy-first approach. Always opt-in, never track without consent.

---

## üí∞ MONETIZATION OPTIONS (Future Consideration)

Current: 100% free, donation-based

Potential future models (if development continues):
1. **Keep free forever** + donations (current model)
2. **Freemium**: Advanced features require one-time payment ($4.99)
   - Training plans
   - Cloud sync
   - Advanced analytics
3. **Premium version**: Separate "Pro" version on app stores
4. **Coaching features**: Paid add-on for personal trainers

Decision: Wait for user feedback before considering paid features.

---

## üîÑ MIGRATION & UPDATES

### Changing App Name Later
Files to update:
1. `app.json` - "name" and "slug" fields
2. `dist/manifest.json` - "name" and "short_name"
3. `App.tsx` - NavigationContainer documentTitle
4. `package.json` - "name" field
5. `README.md` - All references

Deployment impact:
- Vercel: Project name can be changed in settings
- Domain: Add custom domain anytime (no code changes)
- Git: Rename repo on GitHub, update remote URL

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Buy domain (Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains)
2. Add to Vercel: Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add
3. Update DNS records (Vercel provides instructions)
4. HTTPS automatic (Vercel handles SSL certificates)

No app code changes needed for custom domain!
